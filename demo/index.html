      Traas provides an interface where a client can make an HTTP request to the
      server, and will receive a response indicating the reverse path traceoute
      of the router hops in between itself and the remote server. Of interest
      is that the traceroute performed is a TCP traceroute on the connection
      used for the HTTP connection, and as such may provide insight behind
      NAT devices back to the source of client requests. This is especially
      useful in cases with socks or http proxies where http requests can be
      induced, but icmp requests cannot.
